# DEF-Viewer

A web-based DEF Viewer. The main entry point is "index.html", and can be ran directly using any of the latest browsers' releases.  
The DEF Viewer uses jQuery, jQuery.rule, Raphael, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS and HTML to display the data to the browser.

The main implementation can be found at **[main.js](DEFViewer/Scripts/Custom/main.js)**, while the DEF/LEF parsers can be found at **[parsers.js](DEFViewer/Scripts/Custom/parsers.js)**.

For more information about the DEF/LEF files, please refer to to: [lefdefref.pdf](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/14/web/doc/lefdefref.pdf)
